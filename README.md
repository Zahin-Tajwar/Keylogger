## Keylogger

An extremely simple keylogger written in Python. Actually it is a part of my another project(Spyware).

#### Required Libraries:
- pynput
- logging

#### Instruction:
**Run the main py file and it will start capturing key strokes.**
**Notice:** A mail client can be added to it to make it more advanced.
